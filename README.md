We are R-Ladies Paris, a network of R practitioners in Paris. We are a local chapter of a global open source community promoting gender inclusivity among R practitioners and learners, R-Ladies Global.

Our goals are to provide a supportive and encouraging network for R users who identify as female and to promote learning and collaboration in the R community. We are open to anyone interested in programming in R, from experts to novices. Everyone is welcome to join us!

👯 We are open to collaborate on R-related subjects!
